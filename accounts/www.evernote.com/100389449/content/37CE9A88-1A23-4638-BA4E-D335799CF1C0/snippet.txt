Magnetic field of rotating sphere of charge 17 Replies Required math: calculus Required physics: electrostatics & magnetostatics Reference: Griffiths, David J. (2007) Introduction to Electrodynamics, 3rd Edition; Prentice Hall – Problem 5.29. Since any moving charge generates a magnetic field, one way of producing a novel current is to take a uniform sphere of charge and set it spinning on its axis. To work out the field produced by such a sphere, we can start with the field generated by a spinning spherical shell of charge. The derivation of this field is surprisingly tricky, and is given by Griffiths as example 5.11. The results for the vector potential are Here, is the radius of the shell, is the surface charge density and is the angular velocity, where the sphere’s axis is taken to be the axis. From this we can calculate the magnetic field using the standard formula for the curl in spherical coordinates: Notice that although is continuous at , is not. We’ll look at this in more det
