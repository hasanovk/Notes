Project Settings Questions How to tell the Sublime that opens all of the files and folders that I was working on before? Go to “Preferences” -> “Settings” -> “User” ( right panel) settings and add these lines at the end: "hot_exit": false, "remember_open_files": true, ( after “word_wrap” or any last property) With "hot_exit": true present in your settings, Sublime Text will not ask to save changes to files when exiting; it will just exit. Any open and/or changed files will open back up when Sublime Text does starts. Note: The "remember_open_files": true setting doesn't do anything if "hot_exit": true. If "hot_exit": false and "remember_open_files": true, Sublime Text will prompt when closing unsaved changes, and re-open the files on startup.
