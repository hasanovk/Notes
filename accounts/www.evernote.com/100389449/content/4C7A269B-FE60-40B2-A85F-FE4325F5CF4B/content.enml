Here is why I choose the “IPFW” instead of “PF”:</div><div><br /></div><div>- IPFW is SMP aware and gives you better performance (PF is not so good in this area AFAIK)</div><div>- IPFW can be used with Netgraph! It makes you able to build amaizing things (PF can't)</div><div>- IPFW nat can pass FTP and GRE "by default" (PF nat have limitations)</div><div>- IPFW is developed and supported by FreeBSD team with FreeBSD design in mind</div><div>- IPFW have simple, human readable syntax what is easy to understand/remember/use</div></en-note>
