Installing the IPFW Note: Forget about the “IPF” version of the firewall. Here is why I choose the “IPFW” instead of “PF”: - IPFW is SMP aware and gives you better performance (PF is not so good in this area AFAIK) - IPFW can be used with Netgraph! It makes you able to build amaizing things (PF can't) - IPFW nat can pass FTP and GRE "by default" (PF nat have limitations) - IPFW is developed and supported by FreeBSD team with FreeBSD design in mind - IPFW have simple, human readable syntax what is easy to understand/remember/use
