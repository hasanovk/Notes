Tested by : karshi.hasanov@icloud.com Note: These instructions have been verified to work for FreeBSD 10.3, and FreeBSD 11.0 . By default gmirror and the GPT partitioning scheme do not get along. This is because both GEOM (the provider for gmirror) and GPT write meta data at the end of the disk. Note: Instructions on rebuiling a gmirror with this kind of setup are at the bottom under Testing & Replacing A Failed Disk. The concept behind this procedure and “work around” is that instead of mirroring the entire disk, you use gmirror to mirror each of your partitions. The order of these steps is important to avoid corruption. I would only do this on a clean install (and these directions are for that). If you setup a gmirror after the fact on a running machine the gmirror meta data has to get written somewhere, and if you’ve got a file system on it with data, you risk corrupting it and losing data if it happens to be at the end. To avoid this we’ll setup GPT, create the partitions, create t
