The state of mind: Feeling Feeling of a guilt Its like when you loose your charges. Feeling of not having any control of anything. …Having a problem letting go. Why wonderfull night thougts and ideas are no longer wonderful? Its about middle of the night and the wondefull thoughts are keep coming. New ideas about the things and events. It feels so real and so great, no way for me to go to sleep. A lot of fantastic imagination and hope. When I woke up next day, for some reason those thoughts and idea seem to me totally unrealistic and stupid. The worst of all, how many time I have done the same thing over and over again?
