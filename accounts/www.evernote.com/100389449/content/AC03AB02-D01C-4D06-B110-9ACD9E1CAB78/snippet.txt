Removing Unwanted Packages from Windows You can try to remove the packages you don’t want by going “Settings” -> “System” -> “Apps & Features” ( If you you dont’ see this option, try to search ) Windows wil NOT allow to uninstall some of the packages, but you can still remove them using the PowerShell command: These ones I had a problem of removing: 1. Get Help 2. Messaging 3. Microsoft Store 4. Maps 5. Microsoft Edge You need to use the PowerShell as a Administrator: # To list all the packages: => get-appxpackage # To search for a particular package ( case sensative !): => get-appxpackage | findstr <PackageName> # To remove a package you must provide the full package name: => remove-appxpackage <Full Package Name> # While you are in the PowerShell console, you might want to delete this # servic eas well: => sc delete dmwappushservice
