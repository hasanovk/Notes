INTRODUCTION FreeBSD supports many partition schemes. Two most popular are MBR and GPT. While creating a partition, the option "-s" will tells which scheme to use. Usually we use MBR if we need to dual boot and GPT when the drive is dedicated to FreeBSD only. MBR partitions are known as "slices" in FreeBSD world. These slices are containers for FreeBSD filesystems which are referred to as "partitions". FreeBSD can only use primary slices (not extended). GPT doesn't use such containers and all the filesystems are referred to as "partitions". Gpart uses numerical indexes when working with slices/partitions. But the actual entries in /dev/* are not. If the drive is known as /dev/ada1 then the first MBR slice becomes s1 (/dev/ada1s1), the second — s2 (/dev/ada1s2) and so on (up to 4 primary slices). First partition inside s1 slice is known as partition a (/dev/ada1s1a), second — b (/dev/ada1s1b) and so on (up to 16 entries). GPT is simplier: first partition of the ada1 drive becomes /dev/a
