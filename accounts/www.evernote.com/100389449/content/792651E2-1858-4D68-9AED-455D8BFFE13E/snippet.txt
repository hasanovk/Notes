Physical Layer - Data takes the form of bits ( “zeros” and “ones” ) 2. Data Link layer - Data is placed into frames 3. Network Layer - Data is in the form of packets 4. Transport Layer - Data is places into segments 5. Session Layer - Data is simply called “data" 6. Presentation Layer - Data is simply called “data" PDU - Protocol Data Unit = a Layer Data + Header Information : Combination of Data and a specific Layer Header Information. There are two types of Interaction between Layers: TCP/IP Model OSI and TCP/IP Models Mapping: TCP and UDP Protocols TCP Protocol Note: Not all Protocols do both! What happen if the Seq. 200 gets lost? This is the "Error Detection" part of TCP the problem. After the Error Recovery, the recipient will say send me the next Sequence number ( Seq.500) What happen when ACK gets lost? The sender will
