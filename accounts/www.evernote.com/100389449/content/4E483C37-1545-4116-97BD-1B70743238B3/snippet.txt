Method I : Using the Runnable Interface /*** Example 1 : In this example we will show how to implement the Runnable Interface and call the call its methods. The class “HelloRunner.java” which implements the Runnable Interface. ***/ public class HelloRunner implements Runnable { int i; // The Interface has only one method “run()” to override. public void run() { i=0; while ( i < 10 ) { System.out.println (“Created Thread Loop” + i++); } } } # The class “ThreadTester.java” will uses the above class to create the threads public class ThreadTester { public static void main(String[] args) { // Create the instance of the HelloRunner class HelloRunner runner = new HelloRunner(); # Create the Thread object Thread myThread = new Thread(runner); // Start the Thread object. myThread.start(); // This loop belong to the main thread (i.e. the main loop) int i = 0; while ( i < 5) { System.out.println(“This is from the main thread loop” + i++); } } } /*** Example 2: The often we want an object to hand
