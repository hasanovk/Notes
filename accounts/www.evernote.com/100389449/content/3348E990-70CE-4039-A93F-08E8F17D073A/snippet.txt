Introduction to the Spring Beans Creating the Maven Project in Eclipse We assume that you have installed the Maven plugin for Eclipse and it should be available in the Installed software as “Maven Integration for Eclipse”. Step 1: File -> New -> Maven -> Maven Project Step 2: Provide the GroupId and ArtifactId. Usually the GroupId is the package name and and the ArtifactId is a program name. GroupId = ca.kasrhi.spring.beans ArtifactId = MyBeans Setting Up the Spring JAR files. The Spring Framework is the collection of JAR files and its very confusing to get the dependentcies right. Years back the Spring had one package where everything we need was in one place. This is the main reason why we want to use the Maven. The Maven will take care of dependencies and versions. For the basic Spring Framework we need the following JAR files: org.springframework (spring-core, spring-beans and spring-context) To get these files,double click the “pom.xml” and in the bottom click on “Dependency” tab.
