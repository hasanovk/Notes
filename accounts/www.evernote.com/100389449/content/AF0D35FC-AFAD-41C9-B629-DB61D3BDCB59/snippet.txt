Auto Login using the Public-key # Written by KFH: karshi.hasanov@utoronto.ca # Date: May 17, 2002 # Last Modified: July 20, 2017 # Description: Auto Login to a SSH Server using the public key. Theory: The basic idea is that there are two realted numbers, called keys, such that a message encrypted by one can be decrypted by the other, and vice verse. One of these keys is called the public key and the other the private key. The public key is known to everyone while the private key is known only to you. The authentication works essentially like this: The server knows your public key, you know your private key. Permissions The .ssh directory permissions to be 700 (drwx———) The public key (.pub file) to be 644 (-rw-r--r--) The private key (id_rsa) should be 600 (-rw———) Authorized_keys file needs 644 (-rw-r--r—) permissions: chmod 644 /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys Lastly, your home directory should not be writeable by the group or others (at most 755 (drwxr-xr-x)).
