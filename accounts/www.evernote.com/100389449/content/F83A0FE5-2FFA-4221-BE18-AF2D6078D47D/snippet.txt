The Project Goal We want to setup our FreeBSD Server as a Router. Our Server has two interfaces “em0” and “em1”. First interface (“em0”) will be facing to upper router, which is the Bell Internet Router. Will call this as a WAN since it faces outside of our server. All our local computers will be connected to the interface “em1” through a switch or hub. 1. Our first task is make sure that “em0” and “em1” talks each other. To do that all we need is to put the line gateway_enable=“YES” in our “/etc/rc.config”. 2. Second task is to enable the NAT , but the NAT need a firewall to enabled. There are three of them. We decided to go with the “IPFW” ( reasons are explained in my “Firewall-IPFW” notice). 3. We have to tell the NAT to forwad some of the ports which are open behind the interfaces “em1”. Initial Setup and Testing Step 1: Edit the /etc/rc.conf file and add the following lines: # WAN connection , the Wide Areria Network is connected to the first ethernet card ifconfig_em0="inet 192.
