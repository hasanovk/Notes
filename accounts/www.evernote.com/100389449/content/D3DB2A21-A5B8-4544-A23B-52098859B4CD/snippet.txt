Important and often used Concepts About the Java String Object # Strings are special objects in Java. They are stored in a pool of strings for reusability. # They are immutable; you canâ€™t change the value of a String that has been initialized. Autoboxing and Unboxing # Java has a feature called autoboxing, which spares you from explicitly creating a new instance for every primitive # as in the preceding code snippet. ArrayList<intger> myNumbers = new AraayList<>() myNumbers.add( new Integer(1968) ); # We did not have to create an explicitly Intger myInt = new Integer(1968) #Unboxing: Java will automatically convert the object type. No casting neccessary. int myInt = myNubers.get(0); # The first element or item.
