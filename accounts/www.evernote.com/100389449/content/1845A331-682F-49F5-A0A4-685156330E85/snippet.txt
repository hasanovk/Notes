Instead of a hodge-podge of dll’s, drivers, and various occasionally-cooperating executables, everything is done by the Unix kernel. By Mark Sitkowski, C.Eng. M.I.E.E Design Simulation Systems Ltd When Unix was first introduced, the operating system was described as having a ‘shell’, or a user interface which surrounded a ‘kernel’ which interpreted the commands passed to it from the shell. With the passage of time and the advent of graphical window systems on Apollo and Sun computers, in 1983, this model became a bit strained at the edges. However, it still provides a useful mental image of the system, and window systems can be thought of as a ‘candy coat’ around the shell. In fact, it isn’t just X-windows which has a direct path to the kernel, TCP/IP also falls into this category. The following is not intended to be an exhaustive treatise on the
