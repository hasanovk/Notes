Inner Class - The inner class “CircleArea” can see all the variables and methods defined in the “KFH_Math” - You can create an instance of the inner class anywhere inside the class “KFH_Math” class, even inside of any method defined in it. - If you want to have an access to the inner class from outside, its access modifier must be “public” - Each and every instance of the inner class lives inside the outer class instance. - You can NOT create any instance of the inner class whithout creating an instance of the outer class . - The inner classes can talk to each other regardless of thier access modifier as well as if they are “static” or not. public class KFH_Math { private static double PI = 3.1415; private static double GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.6180; private static double EULER_NUMBER = 2.7183; // The Inner Class “CircleArea" public class CircleArea { private double RADIUS; public void setRadius(double r) { this.RADIUS = r; } public double getRadius() { return this.RADIUS; } public double getA
