Last Updated November 14th, 2016: Updated to include that this works under FreeBSD 11.0 as well. Really anything between FreeBSD 9 and 11 should work. April 30th, 2015: This article is really popular, I’ll do my best to keep it up to date! I’ve added notes about TRIM, alignment and GMIRROR (-h) labeling since it was originally posted. Note: These instructions have been verified to work for FreeBSD 9.1, FreeBSD 9.2, FreeBSD 10.0, FreeBSD 10.1, and FreeBSD 11.0 . By default gmirror and the GPT partitioning scheme do not get along.
