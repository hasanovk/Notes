C is a crazy ! Undefined Behavior (UB) UB is a part of the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) C and that lists all of the ways that a C compiler can disregard what you have written. Actuall there is the part of ANSI C standrad which tells you "if you write code like this … then all bets are off and the compiler doesn’t have to do anything consistantly.” For example, UB occures when a C program reads off the end of a string. C defines strings as blocks of memory that ends in a NUL byte ( or “0” byte). No other languages do that. Therefore, when you read a string from other language into C program your might crush. The secret of writing a secure C code is not to trigger UB or to avoid UB as much as you can! Don’t be one the one of those who says “ Well.. UB is the part of the ANSI standard C, so nothing I can do here.."
