<en-note><div>C is a crazy !</div><div><br/></div><div>Undefined Behavior (UB)</div><div>UB is a part of the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) C and that lists all of the </div><div>ways that a C compiler can disregard what you have written. Actuall there is the part of</div><div>ANSI C standrad which tells you &quot;<i>if you write code like this … then all bets are off and the</i></div><div><i>compiler doesn’t have to do anything consistantly.”</i></div><div>For example, UB occures when a C program reads off the end of a string.  C defines </div><div>strings as blocks of memory that ends in a NUL byte ( or “0” byte). No other languages do</div><div>that. Therefore, when you read a string from other language into C program your might crush.</div><div><br/></div><div>The secret of writing a secure C code is not to trigger UB or to avoid UB as much as you can!</div><div>Don’t be one the one of those who says <i>“ Well.. UB is the part of the ANSI standard C, so  nothing</i></div><div><i>I can do here..&quot;</i></div></en-note>
