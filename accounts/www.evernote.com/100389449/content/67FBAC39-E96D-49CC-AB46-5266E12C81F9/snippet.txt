VPN Ports VPN Ports Little Background: Microsoft RRAS server and VPN client supports PPTP, L2TP/IPSec, SSTP and IKEv2 based VPN connection. PPTP control path is over TCP and data path over GRE. L2TP tunnel traffic is carried over IPSec transport mode and IPSec protocol internally has a control path through IKE and data path over ESP. SSTP control and data path is over TCP. IKEv2 control path is over IKE and data path over ESP. So now coming back to original question. There are multiple scenarios: 1) If RRAS based VPN server is behind a firewall (i.e. a firewall is placed between Internet and RRAS server), then following ports need to be opened (bidirectional) on this firewall to allow VPN traffic to pass through: - •For PPTP: •IP Protocol=TCP, TCP Port number=1723 <- Used by PPTP control path •IP Protocol=GRE (value 47) <- Used by PPTP data path •For L2TP: •IP Protocol Type=UDP, UDP Port Number=500 <- Used by IKEv1 (IPSec control path) •IP Protocol Type=UDP, UDP Port Number=4500 <- Use
