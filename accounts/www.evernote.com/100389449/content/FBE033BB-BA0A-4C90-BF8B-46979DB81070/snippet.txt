ZFS: You should use mirror vdevs, not RAIDZ. Continuing this week’s “making an article so I don’t have to keep typing it” ZFS series… here’s why you should stop using RAIDZ, and start using mirror vdevs instead. The basics of pool topology A pool is a collection of vdevs. Vdevs can be any of the following (and more, but we’re keeping this relatively simple): single disks (think RAID0) redundant vdevs (aka mirrors – think RAID1) parity vdevs (aka stripes – think RAID5/RAID6/RAID7, aka single, dual, and triple parity stripes) The pool itself will distribute writes among the vdevs inside it on a relatively even basis. However, this is not a “stripe” like you see in RAID10 – it’s just distribution of writes. If you make a RAID10 out of 2 2TB drives and 2 1TB drives, the second TB on the bigger drives is wasted, and your after-redundancy storage is still only 2 TB. If you put the same drives in a zpool as two mirror vdevs, they will be a 2x2TB mirror and a 2x1TB mirror, and your after-redun
