TomTom Bridge Platform - FAQ 1. When device is removed from charging cradle, display immediately dims due to falling to a low power mode. For eLog inspections, this is a problem if driver is trying to show logs on screen to an inspector; bright makes the situation a lot worst. How can we control this behaviour? ( For purpose of inspections, it would be better to have bright screen at the cost of shorter battery time.) Answer: When device is removed from power it will try to go to sleep but if user presses cancel, the screen remains at the same brightness unless the battery is very low which I don't think would happen often since in theory device would have been plugged to power prior to removing it from cradle. You can select on the device settings (display) to keep screen on when removed from power and also select how long screen should stay on in case of inactivity.
