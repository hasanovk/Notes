Dependency Injection Just another fancy word from the Java World. Nothing special about it. In the real World we will have more than one class obejects and one obejct needs something from an other object. Usually we create an instance of the object which we need in our code and then we start using its methods or properties. In the Java Spring World we assume that our classes is somewhere far away and we don’t have a physical access to modify it. We ask our beans if they can help us with our problems. They call it “Dependency Injection” when we want to inject ( or wire ) some of the methods/properties from other class to our. To do that we need one bean for our class and other beans for each class we want to inject to our bean. For simplicity, we will consider two classes: Our class “Math.java” and other class “Authors.java”. In our class we add one property called “written_by” and we we want to get the authors name from the “Authors.java” class.
