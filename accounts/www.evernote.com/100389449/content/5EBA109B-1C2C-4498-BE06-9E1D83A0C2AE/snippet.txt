SQLite-FAQ How do I modify a Table fields after creating it and using it for a while? Solution 1: If you just want to add a new field, => ALTER TABLE TableName ADD COLUMN ColumnName DataType; # Note: Your new field will add at the end , not between the existing fields ! Solution 2: f you want to make more complex changes in the structure of a table, you will have to recreate the table. You can save existing data to a temporary table, drop the old table, create the new table, then copy the data back in from the temporary table. For example, suppose you have a table named "t1" with columns names "a" and "c" and that you want to insert column "b" from this table. The following steps illustrate how this could be done: BEGIN TRANSACTION; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE t1_backup(a,c); INSERT INTO t1_backup SELECT a,c FROM t1; DROP TABLE t1; CREATE TABLE t1(a,b, c); INSERT INTO t1 SELECT a,c FROM t1_backup; DROP TABLE t1_backup; COMMIT; Now you are ready to insert your new data like so: UPDATE t1 SET
