When ignition is shut off on vehicle, TomTom just shuts the screen off and goes to a low power mode.  If vehicle is parked</b></div><div><b> for the night, the TomTom battery will most likely be completely drained by next morning, then driver cannot use table outside </b></div><div><b>of charging cradle for first half hour or so.</b></div><div><b>The ideal case would be if TomTom could first go to low power mode and then after 10 minutes shutdown power completely.  </b></div><div><b>This would greatly conserve battery for next usage.</b><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><font color="#0433ff"><b><u>Hint: </u></b>A fully charged and in good health battery should last several days in suspend mode.

How can mobility connectivity be disabled for one selected app?  This is easily done in settings on a regular Android phone/tablet; </b></div><div><b>however, the user can just choose to change this whenever they want.</b></div><div><b>For TomTom, this selection needs to be made once at the time TomTom is configured and the user should be locked out of changing </b></div><div><b>this afterward because the user does not know the details of the data plan used by the TomTom device.</b><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b><u><font color="#0433ff">Answer:</font></u></b></div><div><font color="#0433ff">You can create users on device and restrict access to certain items.</font></div><div><a href="https://developer.tomtom.com/bridge/customise/access-restrictions"><font color="#0433ff">https://developer.tomtom.com/bridge/customise/access-restrictions</font></a></div><div><font color="#0433ff"><br/></font></div><div><font color="#0433ff">Also, in case you to manage several devices with same configurations, you can make a backup of the first device you have setup and then </font></div><div><font color="#0433ff">import that backup to each next device so that they all will be loaded with the same settings.</font></div><div><font color="#0433ff">More info here : <a style="color: rgb(4, 51, 255);" href="https://developer.tomtom.com/bridge/customise/settings">https://developer.tomtom.com/bridge/customise/settings</a></font></div><div><br/></div><div><b>4.
